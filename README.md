# AutomIA SpyWeb
Part of the code for this compposant is based on the SpyOn project: https://github.com/edeych/spyon and is therefore licensed under the MIT licence, as chosen by its author.
The rest of the code, initially implemented by members of the Open company, is, in agreement with the company, distributed under the GPL V3 licence, hence the presence of both licences on this repository.

# Instructions
1. Open the website you want to spy on
2. Open the development tools with the F12 key
3. Position yourself on the console
4. Copy and paste all the code in the spyon.js file into the console.
5. Confirm
 --> You can now hover over the elements you want to spy on
 --> Right-click to save the details of an item in a JSON file

 Note: This operation is implemented in the form of an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), so that the spy is active immediately after validation in the console.
